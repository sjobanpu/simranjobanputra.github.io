                    <b class = "tdetails">Timeline: Three Weeks<br></br>My Role: Data Modeling, Pitch, Strategy <br></br>Target User: Anyone that travels or uses public transportation<br></br>Key Methods: Sketch, Adobe After Effects, Storyboard, Scenarios<br></br></b>
                    <p class="tproject">Quickly extracting departure and arrival information while you travel is extremely important. It's especially important when you are<br />traveling via different modes of transporation or have connections. Our stakeholders asked us the question of streamlining travel<br />between flight, ferry, and train schedules in order to make traveling more hassle free. My team and I solved this issue through creating<br />Twave, a data driven display for transportation information. Our key goal was to create more intuitive travel screens that could be more<br />accessible to large audiences, accomplish the specific requirements of our stakeholders, and mitigate the risks associated with<br />misconception and misinterpretation during travel.</p>

                    <h3 class="problemarea">Stakeholders & Transportation Goals</h3>
                    <p  class="basicresearch">There were three main types of stakeholders we dealt with: the traveling employee, the retired grandfather visiting his grandchildren<br />and one of the managers of the transportation systems that really wants customers to use the PTF pass (Plane, Train, Ferry) in order<br />to make the most use of transportation services.</p>

                <h3 class="game">Inspiration & Research</h3>
                <p class="inspiration">Our team created an inspiration board in order to look at what kinds of colors and typefaces would look best. Additionally, we also took into account<br />important situational factors - such as various heights of users and display screen location within the Transportation Hub. The wordle describes<br />some of the issues we discussed.</p>

                <h3 class="key">Key Considerations</h3>
                <b class="layout">Layout</b>
                <p class="layout2">
                How easily a user might read the board’s contents impacts how quickly they can use the information. In the context of a transportation hub, time is critical<br />and a few considerations include: attention to logo styling and placement, use of color to indicate status changes (delays, on-time, etc.), and optimizing<br />layout/visual language for the given screen size, with the potential to display on multiple screen sizes (large screen, desktop, mobile).</p>
                <b class="placement">Placement</b>
                <p class = "placement2"> Where the board is located within the airport, station, or ferry terminal plays a key role in the experience of the user. We need to ensure that multiple<br />users can access the information at the same time and the board is easy to discover/is in an ideal location.</p>
                <b class="usercontext">User Context</b>
                <p class = "usercontext2"> Within the context of a transportation hub, users will bring additional complexity to an interaction with the display board. A successful design will anticipate<br />that users will be in a rush and will need information quickly, users might be first-timers and not experts with the interface, and displays will be accessed<br />in multiple lighting, crowd, and ambient conditions by users of various heights, visual abilities, cultures, backgrounds, and language fluency levels.</p>                <br></br>
                <h3 class="game">Iteration</h3>
                <p class="iterative">We iterated on color, typeface, and the display itself - inspired by a visual layout used in the Vienna International Airport. On our iteration we received that<br />there was far too much text and the legends were difficult to read.</p>

                <h3 class="game" id="mirandaprocess">Process</h3>
                <b><p class="doubletarget">This project was for Interaction Design Studio and took a total of three weeks. I learned a lot about data visualization, after effects/motion, and serving<br />the needs of multiple stakeholders. I contributed to the process and wireframing on Sketch.</p></b>
