                    <b class = "mirandadetails">Timeline: Three Weeks<br></br>My Role: Building the Model, Video Editing, Process <br></br>Target User: Shoppers at Department Stores<br></br>Key Methods: Video Editing, Model Creation, Think Alouds, Script Writing<br></br></b>
                    <p class="mirandaproject">For this project, our goal was to simplify the customer experience and allow them to better engage with store offerings. Our team chose to create<br />Miranda, a conversational user interface that could personalize and elevate the shopping experience to become something more. We wanted to<br />encourage shoppers to come out to stores, instead of hiding behind their screens as they shop online. MIRANDA can be used to both make the<br />store process more streamlined: such as trying on clothes and figuring out what inventory is low and also making the customer feel more inspired<br />by sending personalized recommendations and helping customers better navigate the stores through bluetooth connection.</p>

                    <h3 class="problemarea">Stakeholders</h3>
                    <p  class="basicresearch">We conducted basic research on what kinds of key metrics store managers need to reach and what kinds of questions store customers may have. To<br />writeup this set of questions and thoughts, we did a think aloud of our own shopping experiences and what we found to be difficult/key to the experience.<br />Based on our analysis, there were a lot of things we needed to improve from the store and customer's perspective. We tried to repriotize our brainstorm<br />to determine what features would be most desired to accomplish the goals on both ends.</p>

                <b class="doubletarget">After figuring out that we wanted to build a CUI for the retail experience, we looked at competitor products to identify priority features.</b>

                <h3 class="game">Honing in on Department Stores</h3>
                <b class="doubletarget">We created scenarios for fast fashion, luxury stores, and department stores.</b>
                <br></br>
                <div class="row3" class="move">
                    <div class="column3" id="cuistory1"><img src="miranda/cuistory1.png" alt="looking at the community" width=90%></div>
                    <div class="column3" id="cuistory2"><img src="miranda/cuistory2.png" alt="looking at the community" width=90%></div>
                    <div class="column3" id="cuistory3"><img src="miranda/cuistory3.png" alt="looking at the community" width=90%></div>
                </div>
                <div class="departmentstore">We discovered that were three main categories retails stores were a part of: fast fashion (stores with high turnovers, like Zara), department stores<br/>(like Macy's that catered to many different subgroups of people), and luxury fashion (like Balenciaga, where only the richest could afford to buy clothing).<br />Realizing that the in-person experience is important to luxury fashion and fast fashion would be chaotic to implement through a conversational user<br />interface, we decide to hone our services for department stores. Having a conversational user interface could really elevate the department store<br />experience and create a much smoother shopping experience, given the volume of offerings department stores can have (albeit much more organized<br />and less turnover than fast fashion stores). </div>
