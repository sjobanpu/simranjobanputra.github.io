                    <b class="ucresub">RIDESHARE+ is a pool feature that Carnegie Mellon students can use as safe and inexpensive alternative to the Port Authority Bus System.</b>
                    <br></br>
                    <p class="describe">In September 2018, budgets were cut for Port Authority in order to fund a suffering Pennsylvania state budget. In turn, this led to massive issues<br /> for the population of Pittsburgh, which is heavily reliant on public transportation due to its large student population (University of Pittsburgh,<br /> Carnegie Mellon University, Point Park University, Duquesne University, and Chatham to name a few). RIDESHARE+ could be used by students to<br /> find a cheap and safer alternative to and from campus. <br></br>We conducted our case study with a focus on Carnegie Mellon students. Once a student is registered, they can download the Uber app and get a<br /> code that can activate the CMU Uber extension. This gives students two new options: a CMU Pool, which provides cheaper rides to a regular Uber<br /> during late night study sessions on campus, or CMU Uber, which gives CMU students preference and helps students get to their location in a much<br />  faster time that is also fairly inexpensive. This venture can be funded by the pool of money that is already allocated to transportation from student<br /> tuition, which makes it easy for Carnegie Mellon - they no longer have to spend extra money on a temporary solution. And, by targeting a niche<br /> space, Uber will gain more revenue and build better relationships with students for future rides.</p>

                <b class="mini">RIDESHARE+ was a better option in comparison to current options provided by Carnegie Mellon for safety and convenience.</b>
                <br></br>
                <p class="budget">Currently, Carnegie Mellon has money that is specifically allocated towards transportation. In the implementation of Rideshare, that money would be<br />used to pay towards Uber rides instead of for each tap on the bus system, saving Carnegie Mellon the need to pay for temporary workers and extra buses.</p>

                    <b class="cabinet">As a chair on student cabinet, I was actually able to push for negotiations with Uber to bring Uber pool to campus.</b>
                    <br></br>
                    <p id="negotiate">Many universities around the US now have relationships with Uber and Lyft to have late night ride programs. For example, USC has this contract with Lyft.<br />Since Carnegie Mellon already has a strong relationship with Uber and a campus in Pittsburgh, we got in touch with Uber executives to help them<br />understand why introducing Uber Pool to the campus area would be a great idea. The negotiations are still in the works. We had significant roadblocks<br />due to the size of the Pittsburgh population itself, however, I think the number of temporary residents (i.e. students) isn't taken into account in this space.<br />This was a great experience for me - applying my work from the classroom into the real world and I hope the negotiations are successful in the future.<br></br> In terms of the future of this program, Carnegie Mellon could also begin to use this service to encourage students to explore Pittsburgh more often, since it<br />is much more convenient to get downtown. This would allow Uber to get longer rides and increased revenue from students and in turn, could be a really<br />great opportunity for Carnegie Mellon to shed light on the Pittsburgh community.</p>
