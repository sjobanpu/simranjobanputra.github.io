                    <p class="project">Our client is Construction Junction and they are well known in Pittsburgh for the reused & recycled goods they sell. However, they also want to raise<br />awareness of their events that focus on helping the local community better understand the environment and recycling. Junction Journey just does that<br />by subtly marketing Construction Junction through an interactive game for students. The game can be something that can be played at school for its<br />educational purpose and can be brought back home to continue gaming and sharing the word with parents, in turn targeting two major user groups.<br />Through targeting children and classrooms, we are using the ultime technique of Word of Mouth and reaching more users than just social media<br />marketing. Plus, it's super fun for the kids with its animations and VR settings, while they learn to become better citizens for the future through gaming.</p>

                    <p  class="basicresearch">We conducted basic research on their social media and realized Construction had employed everything they could but wasn't getting much awareness<br />or circulation. Thus, we decided to take a look at the stakeholders to see if there was a group we could target to improve our marketing efforts.</p>

                <p class="schoolage">It was evident from our analysis, that Pittsburgh had a large educational community, which is why we decided to move towards the idea of an educational<br />app. We then brainstormed the best way to reach students, teachers, colleges, elementary schools, etc. We found it best to target school-age children<br />(middle school or below) since they regularly conversate with their parents (targetting two groups).<br></br><b></p>

                <p class="categories">We created three different types of interactions which are the three rows above. Each of the rows has built in microinteractions, such as toggling features.<br />The first row is focused on personal achievement, where we allow the student to win badges based on challenges they achieve. The center panel is an<br />animated milestone anytime they achieve thier target.The second row is for competition, where students can compete with others at their school,<br />classrooms can compete with students at other schools, and there are monthly challenges to excite students about becoming more environmentally<br /> friendly. Finally, the third row is about tying in Construction Junction's outlook. By using VR interactions, we allow students to figure out what can be<br />recyled/reused in their houses and can be brought to the warehouse to be repurposed, sort of bringing the mobile app full circle.</p>
